## About this Project

Playing with MERN I wanted to add API into the website. I created a simple web application where User can add an event with address, and it will display the location with a map using Google Map API.
I think this is a great way to practice applying api into MERN project, specifically calling within React. Thank you for checking out this page.

### Built with
* MongoDB
* Express
* React
* Node.js
* Google Map API
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap

## Getting Started
Starting out the project is simple, install Front-end (React) application (I named the app name "client")
```
npx create-react-app Your-app-name
```
this will create a folder with the name "Your-app-name"
and now create Back-end folder (I named the folder "server", there are many steps)

(Little side not, aquire a google map api through https://developers.google.com/maps)
